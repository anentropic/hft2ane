"""
Modules for the models of the hft2ane package.

Modules should define model classes that inherit from PreTrainedModel
(from huggingface transformers) and have identical names to the corresponding
model classes in the transformers package.

Modules should also define a MODEL_TYPE attribute that is the name of the
base model type, e.g. 'bert' or 'distilbert'.
